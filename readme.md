# What is this?
This program was made for use at work. 
When you run a script made by the Configuration script (See "Get Started" section) the script will connect to the VPN, and then connect to RDP on the VPN network.

## Getting started
- To get started go into the Tools folder and run "Create New Connection.ps1"
- Follow the instructions on-screen (In - Norwegian for now). 
- The script will open a new window to create a new VPN connection. 
- When you have finished the creation, it will let you edit the VPN connection (To set security settings etc.)
- When this is finished the config will close. You now have a new file in the root folder, This is the file you use to connect to VPN and RDP
